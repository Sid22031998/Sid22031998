### Hi there üëã

#### For over 4 years, I've been immersed in the realm of Software Engineering, bringing dedication, diligence, and proactive problem- solving to the table. Holding a bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering, my expertise spans across roles as a Full Stack Developer. My strength lies not only in technical proficiency but also in effective collaboration, bridging the gap between technical and non-technical teams seamlessly.

## What I do
  #### Back End
  As a backend developer, my primary focus is integrating the product, customizing functionality, and ensuring seamless operation. I manage API integrations, server-side logic, and security measures, ensuring a robust backend infrastructure. Proficient in Java, Python, and PHP, I ensure versatility across various programming languages to meet project requirements effectively.
  
  #### Front End
  As a developer, my focus lies primarily on tasks such as creating responsive interfaces and optimizing performance on the frontend, leveraging technologies like React.js. My role also includes debugging, testing, and deploying the application for a smooth user experience. Additionally, I utilize Node.js for server-side logic and integration with platforms like DronaHQ for enhanced functionality.
  
  #### DevOps
  Collaborated closely with development and DevOps teams to establish and reinforce robust automation processes, including the use of shell scripting and Kubernetes (K8s) for container orchestration. This collaboration involved streamlining workflows, implementing best practices, and integrating advanced tools. As a result, the efficiency of the team increased by 26%, leading to faster deployment cycles, reduced errors, and improved overall productivity.
